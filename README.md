# HF103-min
A minimalist re-implementation of Oscar Stella's HF-103 work

Possibly to be renamed ClementineSDR.  Currently just a KiCad capture of parts of Oskar Stella's HF-103/BBRF-103 projects.  This is intended to assist in prototyping for the HamSCI/TAPR receiver atmospheric phenomena.  Will be coupled with a GPSDO design TBD.  

For use in the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) project.
